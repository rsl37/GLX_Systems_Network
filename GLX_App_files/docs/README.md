# GLX Systems Network Documentation

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Start Here

**Before reading any documentation, please review:**

### [CROWDS Design Phase Status Report](./CROWDS_DESIGN_PHASE_STATUS.md)

This critical document clarifies:
- **Current Reality**: CROWDS exists as design specifications, not deployed systems
- **What's Documented**: Comprehensive theoretical frameworks and architecture
- **What Doesn't Exist**: Smart contracts, AI models, reserve backing, regulatory approval
- **Development Timeline**: 18-24 months minimum to production
- **Resource Requirements**: $17.5M-$158M estimated investment needed

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

**CROWDS is currently in Pre-Alpha Conceptual Design phase** - comprehensive design specifications complete, implementation not started.

### What Exists
- ✅ **Comprehensive design documents** (~4,500 lines across 6 major documents)
- ✅ **Novel HFT/HOFT framework** (Holistically Fungible Tokens)
- ✅ **Multi-layer architecture** specification (State/Intelligence/Detection/Response/Evolution)
- ✅ **Integration architecture** with GLX governance platform
- ✅ **Crisis response frameworks** for 20+ categories

### What Doesn't Exist
- ❌ **Smart contracts** deployed on any blockchain
- ❌ **ERC-2048 standard** (proposed, not submitted to Ethereum community)
- ❌ **AI/ML systems** (no trained models or operational infrastructure)
- ❌ **Reserve backing** (no commodity reserves or legal entities)
- ❌ **Regulatory approval** or compliance certification

### Timeline & Resources
- **Time to Production:** 18-24 months minimum from January 2026
- **Estimated Investment:** $17.5M-$158M (highly variable based on scope)
- **Development Phases:** 7 phases from economic modeling through mainnet launch

### GLX Integration Status
- **Design:** CROWDS planned as settlement layer for GLX governance
- **Current:** GLX has working React app; CROWDS is UI mockup only (no real tokens)
- **Reality:** Integration is conceptual architecture, not functional implementation
