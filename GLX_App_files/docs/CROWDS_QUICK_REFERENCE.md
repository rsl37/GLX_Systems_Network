|--------|--------|---------|
| **Current Phase** | Pre-Alpha Design | Specifications complete, implementation not started |
| **Smart Contracts** | ❌ Not Deployed | Zero contracts on any blockchain |
| **AI/ML Systems** | ❌ Not Built | Conceptual frameworks only, no trained models |
| **Reserve Backing** | ❌ Not Established | No commodity reserves or legal entities |
| **ERC-2048 Standard** | ❌ Not Official | Proposed in docs, not submitted to Ethereum |
| **Timeline to Launch** | 18-24 months | From January 2026, requires funding |
| **Estimated Cost** | $17.5M-$158M | Highly variable based on scope |

## ✅ What Exists

**Design Documentation (~4,500 lines)**
- HFT/HOFT theoretical framework
- Five-layer architecture specification
- Crisis response playbooks (20+ categories)
- Multi-dimensional value model
- GLX platform integration architecture

**Novel Contributions**
- Contextual fungibility concept
- Holistically Fungible Token (HFT/HOFT) classification
- Adaptive stablecoin mechanisms
- Context-dependent behavior patterns

---

## ❌ What Doesn't Exist

- Smart contracts or blockchain deployment
- Trained AI/ML models or data pipelines
- Commodity reserves or custody arrangements
- Governance tokens or voting mechanisms
- Security audits or bug bounties
- Regulatory approvals or legal entities
- Cross-chain bridges or oracle integrations
- Liquidity pools or market-making operations

---

## 🗓️ Development Timeline

```
Month 0-6:   Economic modeling and validation
Month 6-15:  Smart contract development + ERC-2048 standardization
Month 9-21:  AI/ML implementation (parallel with contracts)
Month 15-21: Security audits and formal verification
Month 18-24: Testnet deployment and public testing
Month 24+:   Mainnet launch with phased rollout
```

**Critical Path:** Economic validation → Smart contracts → Audits → Testnet → Mainnet

---

## 🔗 GLX Platform Integration

**As Designed:** CROWDS as settlement layer for governance, THI-linked issuance, CMPLX visualization

**Current Reality:** GLX has working React app (pre-beta); CROWDS is UI mockup only (no real tokens)

**Integration Status:** Conceptual architecture documented, not functionally implemented

---

## 📚 How to Reference CROWDS

### ✅ ACCURATE
- "Planned settlement layer for GLX governance"
- "Theoretical framework for context-aware tokens"
- "Pre-alpha specification phase"
- "Architectural design for adaptive stablecoin"
- "Novel HFT/HOFT classification proposal"

### ❌ INACCURATE
- ~~"World's first operational HFT/HOFT"~~ (nothing deployed)
- ~~"Revolutionary proven mechanisms"~~ (unproven)
- ~~"Deployed crisis-resilient token"~~ (doesn't exist)
- ~~Any performance metrics~~ (no data possible)

## 💡 Citable Design Elements

**Systems Theory Foundations** (Established Academic Field)
- Complex adaptive systems principles
- Multi-agent coordination mechanisms
- Emergent properties in token economics

**Original Design Contributions** (Novel but Unproven)
- HFT/HOFT classification beyond fungible/non-fungible binary
- Contextual fungibility (micro/meso/macro/meta contexts)
- Multi-dimensional value: Intrinsic + Systemic + Contextual + Emergent
- Five-layer holistic architecture: State/Intelligence/Detection/Response/Evolution

## 📞 Common Questions

**Q: Is CROWDS operational?**
A: No. Design specifications only. No deployed infrastructure.

**Q: Can I use CROWDS tokens?**
A: No. Tokens don't exist. GLX balances are UI mockups only.

**Q: When will it launch?**
A: 18-24 months from Jan 2026, assuming funding/resources.

**Q: Is ERC-2048 official?**
A: No. Proposed in our docs, not submitted to Ethereum community.

**Q: What's different from other stablecoins?**
A: Design introduces contextual fungibility and crisis adaptation (theoretical, not proven).
