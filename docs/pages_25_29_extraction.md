# Pages 25-29: Complete CROWDS/GLX Compendium & Implementation Guide

## Overview
These pages present the complete, production-ready master specification for CROWDS/GLX, designed as a canonical reference for implementation. They include comprehensive architecture details, security measures, testing strategies, data integrity protocols, modular roadmap, Copilot integration prompts, honest risk assessment, and practical usage instructions.

---

## Canonical Specification Framework

### Purpose
This becomes your **canonical spec** for yourself, Copilot, and any collaborators.

---

## How to Update Your Repo Now

### Implementation Steps

1. **Open CROWDS_Implementation_Plan.md** in your GLX repo

2. **Insert the new sections** (or headings) exactly as outlined above

3. **Commit with a clear message**, e.g.:
   ```bash
   git commit -am "docs: expand CROWDS/GLX plan with Web3, HFT, holarchic, and multi-token"
   git push
   ```

4. **In Copilot Chat**, you can then say:
   > "Use CROWDS_Implementation_Plan.md (all sections) as the authoritative spec.
   > Generate contracts, tests, and APIs step by step, starting with the multi-token
   > architecture and daily action points engine."

---

## Concrete Outline Option

If you want, the next step can be a **concrete outline of all sections** ready to paste into the existing file, and then specific Copilot prompts per section.
