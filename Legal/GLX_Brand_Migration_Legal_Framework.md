# GLX Brand Migration Legal Framework and Trademark Strategy

## 📋 Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete legal framework for the strategic brand migration from "GALAX" to "GLX: Connect the World" for our civic networking platform.

### Strategic Advantages
- **Stronger trademark viability** in Classes 9 & 42 (software/SaaS)
- **Global expansion freedom** through Madrid Protocol filing
- **Respectful homage** to Gatchaman Crowds inspiration without infringement
- **Professional civic tech positioning** aligned with Web3 governance market
