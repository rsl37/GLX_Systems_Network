# Trademark Search Results for "GLX"

Based on my comprehensive search across both US and international trademark databases, here are the findings for the "GLX" trademark:

## US Trademark Findings

- Multiple other GLXY-related trademarks for electronics and mobile devices[8][9]

## Gatchaman Crowds and GLX

Regarding the GLX app from Gatchaman Crowds:

- **Gatchaman Crowds** is owned by **Tatsunoko Production** (established 1962)[15][16]
- The anime features a social networking app called "GLX" that serves as a platform for civic engagement[17][18]
- Tatsunoko Production holds numerous copyrights and trademarks for their original works[15][19]
- **No specific trademark registration found** for the GLX app name from Gatchaman Crowds


## Key Findings for Your Project

### Potential Conflicts:

1. **GLX** is actively registered by **Galaxy Microsystems Limited** for graphics cards (Class 9 - electronics)
2. **GLX PRO** is registered for power tools and machinery
3. **Samsung** holds extensive GLXY-related trademarks for electronics and software applications

### Opportunities:

1. The expired GLX trademark for synthetic crystals/lasers shows the name has been available before
2. **No direct trademark registration** exists for the GLX app concept from Gatchaman Crowds
3. Different trademark classes may allow coexistence (e.g., mobile applications vs. graphics cards)

## Recommendations

1. **Trademark Classes**: Consider filing under **Class 9** (computer software/mobile applications) and **Class 42** (software services), which are standard for mobile apps[20][21]
2. **Potential Issues**: The existing GLX registration by Galaxy Microsystems in Class 9 could pose a conflict for electronics/software applications
3. **Attribution Strategy**: Your plan to credit Gatchaman Crowds and the anime is admirable, but would require permission from **Tatsunoko Production** as the copyright holder
4. **Professional Consultation**: Given the complexity and potential conflicts, especially with Samsung's extensive GLXY portfolio, consulting with a trademark attorney is strongly recommended

The trademark landscape for "GLX" shows some existing registrations but potential opportunities in specific application classes, particularly with proper legal guidance and potentially different branding strategies.
